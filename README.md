Dynamic Hangman Drawing: Visual hangman representation updated with each incorrect guess.

User-Friendly Interface:

Interactive buttons and input fields.

How It Works

A random word is chosen from the word list.

Players guess letters, and correct guesses update the word display.

Incorrect guesses trigger hangman parts to be drawn, with six incorrect guesses leading to game over.

Players can reset the game at the end of each round.

Game Controls

Guess Button: Submits the entered letter.

Entry Field: Allows the player to input a single letter.

Status Bar: Displays remaining attempts.

Project Motivation

This project was created to enhance Python and Tkinter skills while developing an engaging and visually appealing game. It was part of my work during the Keygen Coders Club recruitment.

Future Improvements

Implement word hint functionality.

Add more hangman animations.

Incorporate a leaderboard or scoring system.
